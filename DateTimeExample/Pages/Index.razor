<h1>Hi there</h1>

This very simple control doesn't use JavaScript, can be initialized to a date value and will raise an event after user selection.

I was struggling with the native DateTimePicker as it lacks some customizations, but I couldn't find anything though.. well yes components from big companies but I prefer write my code so I decided to write a very simple one as the logic is quite easy.

This control is not optimized just left it simple and very basic in order to allow everybody to use it and take advantage..

Every suggestion is welcome.

Happy coding

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><DatePicker SelectionChanged="UserSelectedDate"></DatePicker> </td>
        <td><b>@message</b></td>
    </tr>
</table>




@code{
    private string @message;

    private void UserSelectedDate(DateTime date)
    {
        message = $"User selected {date.ToShortDateString()}";
    }
}
